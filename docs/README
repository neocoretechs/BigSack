BigSack - The Purely Java Object Database.

Overview:
A sack is a computer sceince term for a mechanism to manage a collection of unstructured data. BigSack is a Java persistence mechanism 
that provides Java util class TreeSet and TreeMap functionality with a small footprint.
BigSack can function as a striaght TreeMap and TreeSet enhanced replacement, or embedded in its transaction
wrapper for full database commit, checkpoint and rollback semantics.

Exabyte object serialization capability, and tunable cache are some of the other differentiating features. 

The typical workflow is to open a 'database', get a session, perform adds/deletes/updates/retrievals, then commit or rollback. 
Accessing the data is done through methods returning subsets of the ordered set via iterators or Java 8 streams  
like the native Java KeySet and KeyMap collections classes.

Storage Mechanism:
It stores individual key/value pairs as a bTree index spread over a series of 
fixed-length blocks which are double linked. As elements are needed the necessary blocks are paged in to the pool as the 
index is traversed.
The leaf nodes point to data blocks that contain the serialized version of the object, again spread over the necessary blocks.
Multiple tablespace files are dynamically managed by memory mapping and/or file IO. An undo file mirrors the modified
blocks and restores them in the event of a failure. The index to the keys is a BTree composed of serialized internal BigSack
tree pointer classes and its possible to modify their structure and still have them work on old data as long as serialization is 
not broken by the change. Any key or value that can be serialized can be stored. Use good practice for your classes to be used
and add SerialVersionUID's and make sure there are default constructors and use transient keywords where necessary...all good
standard serialization practices that most native Java classes employ. 

Configurable Parameters:
To tune the cache, look at the BigSack.properties file:
#
# Properties for BigSack
#
# L3 cache is our final backing store; File or MMap. this can be changed at will
# File is filesystem based, MMap is memory-mapped demand paging, preferred for very large tables
#L3Cache: File
L3Cache: MMap
#
# Number of pool blocks in runtime buffer pool (bytes=PoolBlocks*BlockSize)
# This can also be modified without fear.  A large pool increases performance at the cost
# of memory
#
PoolBlocks: 8192
#
# these constants are dangerous, dont change them after creating a table
#
# Table page size, or block size, in bytes
#BlockSize: 4096
BlockSize: 1024
# Number of buckets in each tablespace.
# buckets in the BigSack constitute the pre-allocated storage blocks
# More buckets can increase performance of large datasets at the cost of overhead
Buckets: 1024

Parameter Elaboration:
There layout on disk (or card, etc) controlled by Buckets and BlockSize. Buckets are the number of blocks that are
appended to disk when the space is needed, so we allocate a bit more to preplan. Blocksize is the number of bytes in each block
allocated.
PoolBlocks are a pool of database blocks stored in memory and swapped in and out as needed.
L3Cache has 2 options: pure File IO using standard functions or memory mapped IO in which the table spaces are mapped
into virtual memory page file space. MMap is much faster but some but is more complex and may not be suitable for small footprint devices 
with limited memory for swapping and paging.

Running the Demo:
If you just want to get going the program is run by the following:
java -cp bin/BigSack.jar com.neocoretechs.bigsack.test.BatteryBigSack user/TestDB
or right click BatteryBigSack in eclipse and 'Run As Java application'. The app will look for the BigSack.properties and if
not found on the ClassPath will look for a system property. Set up you 'Arguments' tab in eclipse to include the
path and name of directory/database.

A command line example:
java -cp bin/Bigsack.jar -DBigSack.properties=conf/BigSack.properties com.neocoretechs.bigsack.test.BatteryBigSack user/TestDB

A number of functions are performed. If you look in the DB directory you specified on the command line argument you see files <DBNAME>.0 - <DBNAME>.7
and <DBNAME>.log. These are the tablespace files and log file respectively. 

There is also an ant build file in the eclipse project.

Building Your Application:
The options exist to go fully embedded single thread or to use a wrapper to provide concurrency and caching.  The fundamental class to access a DB
is the BigSackSession. Through the session you can directly access database functions add/delete/set/subset etc. No concurrency control really exists
at this level so if you dont need it use the following:
BigSackSession session = SessionManager.Connect(argv[0], true);
Classes that wrap a session are BufferedTreeMap, BufferedTreeSet, and BufferedCachlessTreeSet. At this level concurrency
control is managed through a mutex object and an in-memory cache of deserialized objects is provided. In you app you would do the following:
BufferedTreeMap bm = new BufferedTreeMap(argv[0], true);
and from there use bm to put/get/get your iterators on, etc. The BigSackAdapter class is used to get transactional sessions:

		BigSackAdapter.setTableSpaceDir(argv[0]);
		TransactionalTreeSet session = BigSackAdapter.getBigSackSetTransaction(Class.forName(argv[1]));
		Object o;
		int i = 0;
		session.headSetStream((Comparable) session.first()).forEach(o ->System.out.println("["+(i++)+"]"+o));
		session.headSetStream((Comparable) session.first()).forEach(o -> {			
			System.out.println("["+(i++)+"]"+o);
			comparableClass.mapEntry = (Map.Entry) o;
			...
		});
		session.tailSetStream((Comparable) session.last()).forEach(o -> {
			System.out.println("["+(i++)+"]"+o);
		});
		session.subSetStream((Comparable) session.first(), (Comparable) session.last()).forEach(o -> {
			System.out.println("["+(i++)+"]"+o);
		});
		o = session.first();
		o = session.last();
		boolean x = session.contains(Class.forName(argv[1]).newInstsance("something"));
		session.add(o);
		BigSackAdapter.commitSet(Class.forName(argv[1]));
		-- or ...
		BigSackAdapter.rollbackSet(Class.forName(argv[1]))

Easter Eggs:
Many possibilities exist. If you explore you'll find a mechanism to plug in your own classloader for class resolution. There are AdminSessions that,
working in a multi-user multi-threaded container allow you to put the database online or offline etc.  There are analysis functions stuck
there too.  Of course, its fully thread safe!
