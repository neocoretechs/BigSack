BigSack is a Java persistence mechanism that provides TreeSet and TreeMap key/value store functionality with a small footprint and exabyte object serialization capability. Serializable objects implementing the Comparable interface can be stored backed by a BTree and multiple levels of pooled tuneable cache with durability through undo logging.
